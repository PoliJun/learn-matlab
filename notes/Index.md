In MATLAB, indexing is a powerful way to access and manipulate elements of arrays, matrices, and other data structures. Here are the key concepts and various ways to use indexing in MATLAB:

### 1. Basic Indexing

You can access individual elements of a matrix or array using parentheses `()` and specifying the indices.

#### Syntax

```matlab
element = array(row, column);
```

#### Examples

1. **Accessing an Element in a Vector**:

    ```matlab
    A = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    element = A(3);
    % element = 30
    ```

2. **Accessing an Element in a Matrix**:
    ```matlab
    M = [1, 2, 3;
         4, 5, 6;
         7, 8, 9];
    element = M(2, 3);
    % element = 6
    ```

### 2. Colon Operator for Indexing

The colon operator `:` can be used to select entire rows, columns, or ranges of elements.

#### Examples

1. **Selecting an Entire Row**:

    ```matlab
    row2 = M(2, :);
    % row2 = [4, 5, 6]
    ```

2. **Selecting an Entire Column**:

    ```matlab
    col3 = M(:, 3);
    % col3 = [3; 6; 9]
    ```

3. **Selecting a Submatrix**:
    ```matlab
    subM = M(1:2, 2:3);
    % subM = [2, 3;
    %         5, 6]
    ```

### 3. Linear Indexing

You can also use a single subscript to index into an array. MATLAB treats the array as a single column of elements (column-major order).

#### Examples

1. **Accessing an Element Using Linear Indexing**:

    ```matlab
    A = [1, 2, 3;
         4, 5, 6;
         7, 8, 9];
    element = A(5);
    % element = 5 (fifth element in column-major order)
    ```

2. **Changing Elements Using Linear Indexing**:
    ```matlab
    A(5) = 10;
    % A = [1, 2, 3;
    %      4, 10, 6;
    %      7, 8, 9]
    ```

### 4. Logical Indexing

Logical indexing allows you to select elements based on conditions.

#### Examples

1. **Selecting Elements Based on a Condition**:

    ```matlab
    A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    B = A(A > 3);
    % B = [4, 5]
    ```

2. **Changing Elements Based on a Condition**:
    ```matlab
    A(A > 3) = 0;
    % A = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0]
    ```

### 5. Indexing with Vectors

You can use vectors of indices to select multiple elements.

#### Examples

1. **Selecting Multiple Elements**:

    ```matlab
    A = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    indices = [1, 3, 5];
    B = A(indices);
    % B = [10, 30, 50]
    ```

2. **Selecting Multiple Rows or Columns in a Matrix**:
    ```matlab
    M = [1, 2, 3;
         4, 5, 6;
         7, 8, 9];
    rows = [1, 3];
    cols = [2, 3];
    subM = M(rows, cols);
    % subM = [2, 3;
    %         8, 9]
    ```

### 6. End Keyword

The `end` keyword in indexing refers to the last element in a dimension.

#### Examples

1. **Selecting the Last Element**:

    ```matlab
    A = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    lastElement = A(end);
    % lastElement = 50
    ```

2. **Selecting a Range to the End**:
    ```matlab
    B = A(3:end);
    % B = [30, 40, 50]
    ```

### Summary

-   **Basic Indexing**: Access elements using row and column indices.
-   **Colon Operator**: Select ranges, entire rows, or columns.
-   **Linear Indexing**: Use a single subscript to access elements.
-   **Logical Indexing**: Select elements based on conditions.
-   **Indexing with Vectors**: Use vectors to select multiple elements.
-   **End Keyword**: Use `end` to refer to the last element.
