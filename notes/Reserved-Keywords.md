MATLAB reserved keywords are words that have special meaning in the MATLAB language and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or other identifiers. These keywords are integral to the MATLAB programming environment and are used to perform specific operations or define certain constructs.

### List of MATLAB Reserved Keywords

Here is a list of MATLAB reserved keywords:

-   `break`
-   `case`
-   `catch`
-   `classdef`
-   `continue`
-   `else`
-   `elseif`
-   `end`
-   `for`
-   `function`
-   `global`
-   `if`
-   `otherwise`
-   `parfor`
-   `persistent`
-   `return`
-   `spmd`
-   `switch`
-   `try`
-   `while`

### Example Usage

#### Correct Usage

```matlab
% Using reserved keywords in their proper context
for i = 1:10
    if mod(i, 2) == 0
        disp(['Even number: ', num2str(i)]);
    else
        disp(['Odd number: ', num2str(i)]);
    end
end
```

#### Incorrect Usage

```matlab
% Attempting to use reserved keywords as variable names (will result in an error)
for = 5; % Incorrect, 'for' is a reserved keyword
end = 10; % Incorrect, 'end' is a reserved keyword
```

### Practical Example

Here is a practical example demonstrating the use of several reserved keywords:

```matlab
function exampleReservedKeywords()
    % Demonstrating the use of reserved keywords

    % 'for' loop
    for i = 1:5
        try
            % 'if' condition
            if mod(i, 2) == 0
                disp(['Even number: ', num2str(i)]);
            else
                disp(['Odd number: ', num2str(i)]);
            end
        catch ME
            % 'catch' block
            disp(['Error: ', ME.message]);
        end
    end
end
```

### Summary

-   MATLAB reserved keywords have special meanings and are used to perform specific operations or define constructs.
-   These keywords cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers.
-   Common keywords include control flow statements (`for`, `if`, `while`, `switch`), error handling (`try`, `catch`), and others like `end`, `function`, and `classdef`.

By being aware of and avoiding the use of reserved keywords for variable or function names, you can prevent syntax errors and improve the readability of your MATLAB code.
